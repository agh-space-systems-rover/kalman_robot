  ros__parameters:
    queue_size: 10

    world_frame: "map" # The frame to which transform the point cloud before processing. It must have a world-aligned pitch and roll, so that slope can be calculated. (default: "map")
    normal_estimation_radius: 0.2 # The radius for normal estimation. (default: 0.2)
    max_ground_angle: 0.5 # The maximum angle between the up vector and the normal for a point to be considered ground. (radians, default: 30 degrees)
    
    outlier_removal_radius: 0.2 # The radius for the outlier removal filter. (default: 0.2)
    outlier_removal_min_neighbors: 10 # The minimum number of neighbors for the outlier removal filter. (default: 10)

    robot_frame: "base_link" # The frame of the robot. (default: "base_link")
    min_obstacle_height: -1.0 # The minimum height relative to the robot for an obstacle point to be considered. Height is not affected by robot rotation. (default: -1.0)
    max_obstacle_height: 0.5 # The maximum height for an obstacle point to be considered. (default: 1.0)
